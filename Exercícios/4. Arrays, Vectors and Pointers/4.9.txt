Initially, ref_x and ref_y store the memory adress of x and y, respectivly.
Then, the memory adress of y is assigned to ref_x.
Now, x will store the same value as y, as their memory adress is the same.
Finally, their memory adress will be the same.

Initially, ptr_x and ptr_y store the memory adress of c and y, respectivly.
Then, them memory adress of y s assigned to ptr_x.
Now, x will store the same value as y, as their memory adress is the same.
